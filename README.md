#### [GEOgraphic coordinates TRANslator](https://github.com/Geo-Linux-Calculations/geotranz)

GEOTRANZ (Geographic Translator) is an application program which allows
you to easily convert geographic coordinates among a wide variety of
coordinate systems, map projections, and datums. Currently, twenty-five
different coordinate systems, map projections, grids, and coding
schemes, and over two hundred different datums, are supported.

The user interface of GEOTRANZ is similar to that of a calculator, but
can also be used to efficiently convert large numbers of coordinates
contained in text files.

GEOTRANZ is the Debian name of GEOTRANS, a product of the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and U.S. Army Engineering Research
and Development Center.
