It was downloaded from http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/geotrans/


The package GEOTRANZ is derived from GEOTRANS:

"The product was developed using GEOTRANS, a product of the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and U.S. Army Engineering Research and
Development Center."

"Do not use the name GEOTRANS for any derived work."

Debian modifications are the following: add makefiles to compile it with
openjdk; modify some icons so they have a transparent background; use
x-www-browser to lunch help instead of netscape; modify directory where help
files are; add missing includes in C files to fix implicit declaration
warnings.

Debian package GEOTRANZ is DFSG free because:

-Everyone is allowed to use and distribute the software (see terms of use).
-Everyone is allowed to modify the software "develop derivative works"
 (see terms of use).
-Everyone is allowed to make and distribute derived works if the "GEOTRANS"
 name is not used. (see terms of use and clarification mail from authors).
-The package is compiled with and depends on free packages only (thanks to
 openjdk).

Sir,

Please find an updated "Terms of Use" for GEOTRANS. Our position is that
derivative works may be distributed, if they adhere to these "Terms." A
new version (GEOTRANS 2.4.2) will be made available shortly.

Thank You,
